    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answer business requirement 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "  > The client has expressed an interest in determining the presence of powdery mildew on a given leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The output includes image shape embeddings stored as a pickle (.pkl) file, which contains the extracted representations of the images from the test, train, and validation folders, including their respective subfolders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Images Distribution Plot: A visualisation depicting the distribution of images across the train, validation, and test sets. This plot provides insights into the dataset's composition and the balance between the different sets.\n",
    "- Label Distribution Bar Chart: A bar chart illustrating the distribution of labels in the dataset. This visualisation helps understand the frequency of different classes or categories present in the data.\n",
    "- Set Distribution Pie Chart: A pie chart showcasing the distribution of images across the train, validation, and test sets. This chart presents the proportions or percentages of images in each set, giving a comprehensive overview of the dataset partition.\n",
    "- Image Augmentation: An augmentation technique applied to the images, which involves performing various transformations such as rotation, scaling, or flipping. This process enhances the diversity of the dataset and helps improve model generalization.\n",
    "- Augmented Images Plot: Plots showcasing the augmented images for each set, providing a visual representation of the transformations applied.\n",
    "- Class Indices for Prediction Inference: Indices assigned to each class label to facilitate prediction inference in the output.\n",
    "- Machine Learning Model Creation and Summary: The creation of a machine learning model specific to the task at hand. A summary of the model's architecture, including the number of parameters and layer configurations, is displayed.\n",
    "- Model Training: The training of the machine learning model using the provided dataset. During this process, the model learns to make predictions based on the input data and the associated labels.\n",
    "- Model Saving: The saved model is stored for future use or deployment in production environments.\n",
    "Learning Curve Plot: A plot illustrating the model's performance over training epochs. This plot shows the trend of accuracy or loss metrics as the model learns from the training data.\n",
    "- Model Evaluation: The evaluation of the trained model's performance using saved evaluation files. This includes calculations of accuracy, plotting of the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve, and generation of a classification report.\n",
    "- Classification Report: Detailed metrics and statistics summarizing the model's performance. This includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score values, which can vary based on the specific model (Model A, Model B, or Model C).\n",
    "- Confusion Matrix Plot: A visual representation of the confusion matrix, which displays the predicted labels versus the true labels. This plot helps identify any patterns or trends in misclassifications.\n",
    "- Evaluation Results Saving: The saving of evaluation results, including accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrix, in a pickle file format for future reference or analysis.\n",
    "- Prediction on Random Image File: The model's prediction on a randomly selected image file, providing an example of the model's inference capabilities on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "- To meet the client's requirements and enhance data understanding, multiple versions of the data were plotted. These versions provided additional insights and catered to potential requests for deeper comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The construction of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) prioritized achieving high accuracy while minimizing both loss and training time. The CNN architecture was meticulously designed to strike a balance between model size and performance. It was carefully kept as compact as possible without compromising accuracy or falling victim to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Further details regarding hyperparameter optimization, as well as an account of the trial and error phase, have been extensively documented in both the readme.md file. These resources provide in-depth analysis, explanations, and insights into the process of fine-tuning the model for optimal performance.\n",
